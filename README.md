# CS-255

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass. DriverPass is a web-based application to train students for a driving test and to keep updated with driving laws. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well on the System Components and Design section of the Business Requirements Document. I felt this way because I made sure to include all the details possible.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise a part, it would be the GANTT chart in the Business Requirements Document. As I had limited templates to pick from, some of the time frames look like it extends longer than it does, vice versa for when the task begins. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the interview over and over. There were times I caught something I previously didn't, so continuous reviewing gave me the ability to be thorough. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing to give them the product they envisioned, or better. In some cases, you will be unable to produce exactly what they want - but with good communication you can review whats possible to give a similar output.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
