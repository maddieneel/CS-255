# CS-255

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass. DriverPass is a web-based application to train students for a driving test and to keep updated with driving laws. It will give the students the ability to buy driving packages and create an account which will then let them take online tests, review the drivers notes based on their lesson, and more.

# What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well on the System Components and Design section of the Business Requirements Document. I felt this way because I went indepth with all the requirements and overall goals.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise a part, it would be the GANTT chart in the Business Requirements Document. As I had limited templates to pick from, some of the time frames look like it extends longer than meant to, vice versa for when the task begins. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the interview over and over. There were times I caught something I previously didn't, so continuous reviewing gave me the ability to be thorough. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing to give them the product they envisioned, or better. In some cases, you will be unable to produce exactly what they want - but with good communication you can review whats possible to give a similar output.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

To begin with, I would start by completing a Business Requirements Document. This document allows to get a brief overview of what the system will consist of, the requirements, possible limitations, and the timeframe each task should be completed. Afterwards, I would begin creating many different types of diagrams to get a better understanding of the flow, relationships, methods/attributes that will be used, and more. These approaches will be useful in guaranteeing that all requirements and perspectives are met.
